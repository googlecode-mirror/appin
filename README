** 0. Introduction *************************************************************

Appin is a simple framework written in php/html/javascript to design and
evaluate user interfaces for touch enabled phones using a web interface. 

The goal is to provide a method to switch between different screens (or views as 
they are called in this document) and give total control over the rest of the 
interface. For simplicity, jquery is available (and used for the view switching)
to use within the views.

** 1. FILES AND DESCRIPTIONS ***************************************************

Appin relies on the following files:
 - index.php, where everything is presented to the end evaluator
 - viewHandler.php, a php script to support the switching of views
 - views, a folder with the views
 - appin-js.js, the javascript that makes up the core functionality

1.1 index.php
Index.html presents everything to the evaluator and is a simple simulator for
a phone with three physical buttons: back, reset and menu (please see 4. ABOUT
BUTTONS to learn more). 

In the top of the file you can change the width and/or height of the simulated
phone. (A good thing to keep in mind is that the iPhone has an aspect ratio of
3:2.) The default is a width of 320 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

1.2 viewHandler.php
ViewHandler.php is a php script that (with the help of AJAX) render the views.
For more information, please consult the comments in viewHandler.php.

1.3 views
In the directory "views" the views are placed (see 3.1).
As default there is only one view, main. IT SHOULD NOT BE DELETED.

1.4 appin-js.js 
The javascript functions to handle the view switching.

** 2. INSTALLATION *************************************************************

Copy index.php, jquery.js, viewHandler.php and (the directory) views to the 
desired location on a web server. You need to have php enabled for Appin to 
work.

If Appin is to used offline, it is a good idea to download jQuery and disable
the use of Google CDN.

** 3. HOW TO USE ***************************************************************

3. HOW TO USE
Every screen that is presented is called a "view". When the application is
started the view "main" is shown. Jquery is available for using.

3.1 About views:
Each view is a set of three files (index.html, css.css and js.js) that lies in a
folder with the same name as the view. All the views are placed in the "views"
directory.

3.2 Adding a view:
When adding a view, create a folder with its name and the three files 
index.html, css.css and js.js. Then write appropriate content for each file 
(place the html in index.html, the css in css.css and the javascript in js.js).

3.3 Linking / switching between views:
To change the view call the javascript function setView(view), where view is a
string with the name of the view to switch to. This can (for example) be done
with a button:
	<button onclick="setView('myView');">Change view to myView</button>
or a link:
	<a href="" onclick="setView('myView');">Change view to myView</a>

3.4 Adding a menu for the menu button
A div element with the id "menu" is considered to be a menu. Use this and place
and create the menu as you wish. When the user presses the menu button the div
will be toggled by jquery.

3.4.1 About rotating
To support the menu when the view has been rotated it, please don't give the
menu a relative position and hard code distance to the top.

** 4. ABOUT THE PHYSICAL BUTTONS ***********************************************

There are three "physical" buttons: back, reset and menu to make the simulator
more familiar to users of the Android mobile operating system. Each button has
its own actions.

4.1 Back
The back button shows the previous view.

4.2 Reset 
The Reset button restarts the application.

4.3 Menu
The menu button tries to open or close the menu. Please see 3.4 for more 
information.

4.4 Rotate
Press this button to switch between portrait and landscape mode.

** 5. INCLUDING IMAGES AND OTHER THINGS ****************************************

To include an image in a view, place the image IN THE DIRECTORY OF THE VIEW (or
a sub directory) and write as you normally would:
	<img src="myImage.jpg" ...>
viewHandler.php will automatically add the correct path for the image by
replacing src="myImage.jpg" with src="views/myView/myImage.jpg".

EVERY src="..." WILL BE REPLACED WITH src="views/myView/..." in index.html.

5.1 Example
Suppose you have the image monkey.jpg placed in the view animals.
To include the image, write
	<img src="monkey.jpg">
The presented html will be 
	<img src="views/animals/monkey.jpg">
and the image will appear as it should.
